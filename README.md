# A-B-testing-in-dating-app
An academic project on interpretation of A/B test results
Imagine we have a large dating application.
In addition to the basic functions, the application also has a premium subscription, which gives access to a number of important additional features.
An A/B test was conducted, in which the cost of a premium subscription* was changed for new users from several countries when buying through two new payment systems.
At the same time, the cost of the trial period remained the same.
So we're going to check out:
- Whether the experiment was successful in general.
- Analyze whether the innovation makes sense among any specific groups of users.
*The money for the subscription is debited monthly until the user cancels it.
